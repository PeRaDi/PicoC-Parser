# PicoC
**Artificial Intelligence course project**

The PicoC-Parser is a Mini C language parser built using PLY Yacc. It is designed to parse Mini C programs and generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the program. The repository includes several Python scripts for **parsing**, **lexical analysis**, and **semantic analysis** of Mini C programs. Additionally, it provides a **strategy for instrumenting test cases** and **generating mutants for testing purposes**.
